        <h1>What Industry Experts Are Saying About Our AI Future</h1>
        <img src="article3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Article Image">
        <p class="mt-2">The global AI market is projected to expand at an annual rate of 37.3% between 2023 and 2030.
            While there are concerns about the potential negative impacts this accelerated growth could cause, 64% of
            businesses are optimistic that AI will enhance their overall productivity. What’s more, this growing belief
            in AI's capacity to revolutionize business processes coincides with the pressing need to bridge gaps across
            various global industries.</p>

        <p>Whether it’s limited access to health care, generalized education, or insufficient resources in philanthropy
            work, experts foresee that the rapid advancement of technology will play a significant role in democratizing
            resources to address these challenges.</p>

        <h3>Health Care</h3>
        <p>Over 75% of cases involving chronic respiratory diseases like Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,
            and Post Tuberculosis Lung Impairment go either undiagnosed or are diagnosed late. High expenses associated
            with pulmonary function tests, shortages of skilled technicians, and a lack of pulmonologists at primary
            care levels restrain the accessibility of these essential services.</p>

        <p>Briota Technologies, a provider of AI-enabled primary health care services in India, extends screening and
            diagnostic services directly to local communities. Having served over 100,000 individuals in the comfort of
            their homes, this solution eliminates the need for them to journey to a district hospital.</p>

        <p>“AI is helping us to democratize this diagnostics process which was available only to a select few,” says Dr.
            Gajanan Sakhare, founder of Briota.</p>

        <img src="article3.1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Article Image">
        
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>Briota’s Spirometry Assisted Virtually Early (SAVE) uses generative AI to streamline standard procedures,
            reducing reliance on highly specialized medical expertise and enabling available semi-skilled workers to
            conduct tests and diagnoses.</p>

        <p>While Sakhare emphasizes the irreplaceable proficiency of a skilled doctor, he acknowledges that emerging
            technology can handle routine tasks and negate the necessity for an expert to be physically present for
            health services when one is unavailable. By harnessing AI, individuals lacking the expertise of specialists
            can execute tasks typically reserved for such professionals.</p>

        <p>“AI is assisting a semi-skilled person to become––to some extent––a skilled person,” said Sakhare.</p>

        <h3>Philanthropy</h3>
        <p>About 75% of nonprofit organizations have experienced an increase in demand for their programs, while around
            68% are facing a reduction in funding, resulting in a notable volume of turnover and burnout across the
            sector.</p>

        <p>According to Nick Cain, Director of Strategic Grants, the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation is advocating for
            the adoption of generative AI to streamline labor-intensive tasks for burdened workers. Cain predicts
            integrating AI into philanthropic endeavors can enable companies to create new campaigns, manage donor
            engagement, and explore innovative approaches to drive positive social impact.</p>

        <p>“It can lower the barrier to entry to do those things, and when you better understand your data, you might
            uncover a new service you want to offer,” says Cain. “You might uncover an insight about the community that
            you're serving that you wouldn't have found otherwise.”</p>

        <h3>Embracing AI and ML</h3>
        <p>Enhancing user productivity</p>
        <p>In 2005, a team of two amateur chess enthusiasts clinched victory in the computer-assisted PAL/CSS Freestyle
            Chess Tournament, besting teams of chess grandmasters. Lacking the chess skills and powerful computers held
            by other participants, they won by effectively balancing computer recommendations with their own strategic
            judgment.</p>

        <p>Vuchic uses this anecdote to demonstrate that simply possessing powerful technology is insufficient to achieve
            a desired objective.</p>

        <p>“You can have access and you can have compute, but if the users are not using the technology in appropriate
            ways, they will not get the impact that was intended,” says Vuchic.</p>
