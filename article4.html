        <h1>Unlocking Money for Child Care Providers</h1>
        <img src="article4.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Article Image">
        <p class="mt-2">The average annual wage for child care workers in the United States is $27,680. The federal poverty level is $27,750 for a family of four, leaving care workers vulnerable, underpaid, and under-appreciated. Additionally, 95% of child care workers are women and 59% of child care centers are minority-owned. This issue has led to child care shortages, which were only exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

            Rebecca Karasik and Chelsea Sprayregen, Co-Founders of Pie for Providers, are tackling these problems by streamlining the process to get government funding to child care providers. 
            
            Karasik and Sprayregen began this endeavor after working at a benefits enrollment start-up that helped connect citizens with Obamacare, Medicaid, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
            
            “Working at that job showed us how inhumane and punitive the systems are related to benefits access. We also worked directly with child care workers who qualified for these benefits, so we were inspired by them and wanted to make sure child care benefits were not overlooked,” shared Karasik.
            
            “We believe the government is allocating money, although not enough, towards child care, but it’s not getting to families and kids or the providers who need it. Only one out of every six children eligible for the Child Care Subsidy is receiving the subsidy. That equates to 10 million eligible children across the country that aren’t getting what they need,” says Karasik. 
            
            To address this issue, Pie For Providers – a non-profit software as a service (SaaS) platform – finds revenue opportunities and helps child care businesses see their data in one location. 
            
            “We give providers revenue projections throughout the entire month and they are updated in real-time. This helps providers have control of their businesses and allows them to make informed decisions. We also help providers electronically file paperwork. We hope to eliminate the typical manual monthly billing process. And to make access to revenue simpler, we put all the requirements in the state’s required format,” said Karasik.
