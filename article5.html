        <h1>How Hydroponics are Solving Climate Challenges and Food Insecurity in the Navajo Nation</h1>
        <img src="article5.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Hydroponics in the Navajo Nation">
        <p class="mt-2">The global AI market is projected to expand at an annual rate of 37.3% between 2023 and 2030. The Navajo Nation Reservation is a rural area classified as a food desert by the United States Department of Agriculture. There are only 13 grocery stores that offer fresh fruit, vegetables, and basic supplies in the Navajo Nation. These grocery stores are only in high population areas in the Reserve. Compared to off-reservation stores, the products sold here are poorer quality and cost more. There are also trading posts, convenience stores, and gas stations across the Nation that offer highly processed, canned, dry, and unhealthy foods. The Navajo Nation experiences limited access to affordable healthy foods, which contributes to increased obesity and diabetes prevalence among the Navajo people.</p>

        <p>Within the Navajo Nation, the food insecurity rate is 76.7%, which is the highest reported rate in the United States due to structural challenges, high unemployment, geographic barriers, and limited varieties and quantities of fruits and vegetables, along with difficulty in accessing food due to high poverty rates. Historically, Navajo people have sustained their food security through their connection to the land, water, and all living entities. Colonization and displacement have increased Native people’s likelihood of experiencing health disparities like diabetes. Colonialism changed the traditional diets of the Navajo people, causing a change in lifestyle and creating social and economic inequalities that contribute to food insecurity. Numerous issues with the Navajo people’s health, land, and water due to capitalist and colonial practices have limited their ability to grow traditional foods and address health issues.</p>

        <p>Today, the Navajo Nation is on the front line of climate change and is experiencing severe drought due to extraction companies nearby and on the reservation land. This has affected traditional plants, food production, and food access. Climate change has exacerbated economic, social, and environmental tensions that contribute to food and water insecurity. The effects are devastating, especially for Navajo people who rely on the land for sustenance and cultural vitality.</p>

        <h3>How Hydroponic Systems Work</h3>
        <p>Hydroponics is a sustainable food production system that uses less water than traditional field crop watering methods, produces higher yields of plants in a shorter time frame, uses less space (as it can be grown vertically), and doesn’t require soil. The use of these systems does not contribute to the destruction and disruption of topsoil, whereas industrial agriculture has severely depleted topsoil integrity and biodiversity in the US.</p>
        <p>The use of this system in Native communities can contribute to an increase in fresh fruit and vegetable consumption within the typical household while providing access to healthier foods and increasing awareness and knowledge about climate change and the importance of sustainable food production. Hydroponic systems can provide a reimagined food source for the Navajo Nation in the American southwest while being water-conscious.</p>

        <h3>The Nurturing Plants Solution</h3>
        <p>Nurturing Plants addresses multiple problems including obesity, diabetes, food insecurity, and climate change while revitalizing and reclaiming traditional foods and leafy greens into the daily diet of the Navajo people. The program leads a series of five hydroponic workshops that provide future farmers, beginning farmers, and advanced farmers with the skills and knowledge to apply sustainable and conservation practices to their own farms, gardens, and backyards. Participants receive a free hydroponic system, seeds, farm tools, and more to implement practices taught within the workshops.</p>
        <p>The program is designed to be three months long and requires participants to attend five hands-on workshops and one community gathering and to grow food using the hydroponic system. The workshops range from one to two hours and occur twice a month.</p>
